    <h1>Christopher Nolan</h1>
    <p><a id="vasen" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Nolan"><img id="vasen" src="https://quotepark.com/media/authors/christopher-nolan.jpeg" alt=""></a>Christopher Nolan[1] CBE (/ˈnoʊlən/; born 30 July 1970) is a British-American film director, producer, and screenwriter. His films have grossed more than US$5 billion worldwide and have garnered 11 Academy Awards from 36 nominations.

Born and raised in London, Nolan developed an interest in filmmaking from a young age. After studying English literature at University College London, he made his feature debut with Following (1998). Nolan gained international recognition with his second film, Memento (2000), for which he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. He transitioned from independent to studio filmmaking with Insomnia (2002), and found further critical and commercial success with The Dark Knight Trilogy (2005–2012), The Prestige (2006), and Inception (2010), which received eight Oscar nominations, including for Best Picture and Best Original Screenplay. This was followed by Interstellar (2014), Dunkirk (2017), and Tenet (2020). For Dunkirk, he earned an Academy Award nomination for Best Picture and his first nomination for Best Director.
Nolan's films are typically rooted in epistemological and metaphysical themes, exploring human morality, the construction of time, and the malleable nature of memory and personal identity. His work is permeated by mathematically inspired images and concepts, unconventional narrative structures, practical special effects, experimental soundscapes, large-format film photography, and materialistic perspectives. He has co-written several of his films with his brother Jonathan, and runs the production company Syncopy Inc. with his wife Emma Thomas.
Nolan has received many awards and honours. Time named him one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2015, and in 2019, he was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire for his services to film.

  Nolan was born in Westminster, London, and grew up in Highgate.[2][3] His father, Brendan James Nolan, was a British advertising executive who worked as a creative director.[4] His mother, Christina (née Jensen), was an American flight attendant who would later work as an English teacher.[4][5][6] Nolan's childhood was split between London and Evanston, Illinois, and he has both British and US citizenship.[7][8][9] He has an elder brother, Matthew,[10] and a younger brother, Jonathan, also a filmmaker.[11] Growing up, Nolan was particularly influenced by the work of Ridley Scott, and the science fiction films 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) and Star Wars (1977).[12][13] He began making films at age seven, borrowing his father's Super 8 camera and shooting short films with his action figures.[14][15] These films included a stop motion animation homage to Star Wars called Space Wars. He cast his brother Jonathan and built sets from "clay, flour, egg boxes and toilet rolls."[12] His uncle, who worked at NASA building guidance systems for the Apollo rockets, sent him some launch footage: "I re-filmed them off the screen and cut them in, thinking no-one would notice", Nolan later remarked.[5][16][17] From the age of eleven, he aspired to be a professional filmmaker.[11] Between 1981 and 1983, Nolan enrolled at Barrow Hills, a Catholic prep school in Weybridge, Surrey, run by Josephite priests.[18] In his teenage years, Nolan started making films with Adrien and Roko Belic. Nolan and Roko co–directed the surreal 8 mm Tarantella (1989), which was shown on Image Union, an independent film and video showcase on the Public Broadcasting Service.[note 1][22][23]

  After earning his bachelor's degree in English literature in 1993, Nolan worked as a script reader, camera operator, and director of corporate videos and industrial films.[6][26][28] In 1995, he began work on the short film Larceny, which was filmed over a weekend in black and white with limited equipment and a small cast and crew.[22][29] Funded by Nolan and shot with the UCLU Film society's equipment, it appeared at the Cambridge Film Festival in 1996 and is considered one of UCL's best shorts.[30] He filmed a third short, Doodlebug (1997), about a man seemingly chasing an insect with his shoe, only to discover that it is a miniature of himself.[25][31] Nolan and Thomas made their first attempt at a feature in the mid-90s with a project called Larry Mahoney, which was scrapped and never released.[32] During this period in his career, Nolan had little or no success getting his projects off the ground; he later recalled the "stack of rejection letters" that greeted his early forays into making films, adding "there's a very limited pool of finance in the UK. To be honest, it's a very clubby kind of place ... Never had any support whatsoever from the British film industry."[33]

  Nolan is married to Emma Thomas, whom he met at University College London when he was 19.[11][27] She has worked as a producer on all of his films, and together they founded the production company Syncopy Inc.[169] The couple have four children and reside in Los Angeles, California.[170][171] Protective of his privacy, he rarely discusses his personal life in interviews.[172] However, he has publicly shared some of his sociopolitical concerns for the future, such as the current conditions of nuclear weapons and environmental issues that he says need to be addressed.[173] He has also expressed an admiration for scientific objectivity, wishing it were applied "in every aspect of our civilization."[174] Nolan made a donation to Barack Obama's presidential campaign in 2012,[175] and he serves on the Motion Picture & Television Fund (MPTF) Board of Governors.[176]

Nolan prefers not to use a mobile phone or an email address,[177] saying, "It's not that I'm a Luddite and don't like technology; I've just never been interested ... When I moved to Los Angeles in 1997, nobody really had cell phones, and I just never went down that path."[178] In an interview with People in December 2020, Nolan confirmed he does not have an email or a smartphone, but has a "little flip phone" that he takes with him from time to time.[179]
