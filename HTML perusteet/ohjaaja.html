    <h2>Christopher Nolan</h2>
    <p><a id="vasen" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Nolan" target="_blank"><img id="vasen" src="https://quotepark.com/media/authors/christopher-nolan.jpeg" alt=""></a>Christopher Nolan[1] CBE (/ˈnoʊlən/; born 30 July 1970) is a British-American film director, producer, and screenwriter. His films have grossed more than US$5 billion worldwide and have garnered 11 Academy Awards from 36 nominations.

Born and raised in London, Nolan developed an interest in filmmaking from a young age. After studying English literature at University College London, he made his feature debut with Following (1998). Nolan gained international recognition with his second film, Memento (2000), for which he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. He transitioned from independent to studio filmmaking with Insomnia (2002), and found further critical and commercial success with The Dark Knight Trilogy (2005–2012), The Prestige (2006), and Inception (2010), which received eight Oscar nominations, including for Best Picture and Best Original Screenplay. This was followed by Interstellar (2014), Dunkirk (2017), and Tenet (2020). For Dunkirk, he earned an Academy Award nomination for Best Picture and his first nomination for Best Director.
Nolan's films are typically rooted in epistemological and metaphysical themes, exploring human morality, the construction of time, and the malleable nature of memory and personal identity. His work is permeated by mathematically inspired images and concepts, unconventional narrative structures, practical special effects, experimental soundscapes, large-format film photography, and materialistic perspectives. He has co-written several of his films with his brother Jonathan, and runs the production company Syncopy Inc. with his wife Emma Thomas.
Nolan has received many awards and honours. Time named him one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2015, and in 2019, he was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire for his services to film.

  Nolan was born in Westminster, London, and grew up in Highgate.[2][3] His father, Brendan James Nolan, was a British advertising executive who worked as a creative director.[4] His mother, Christina (née Jensen), was an American flight attendant who would later work as an English teacher.[4][5][6] Nolan's childhood was split between London and Evanston, Illinois, and he has both British and US citizenship.[7][8][9] He has an elder brother, Matthew,[10] and a younger brother, Jonathan, also a filmmaker.[11] Growing up, Nolan was particularly influenced by the work of Ridley Scott, and the science fiction films 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) and Star Wars (1977).[12][13] He began making films at age seven, borrowing his father's Super 8 camera and shooting short films with his action figures.[14][15] These films included a stop motion animation homage to Star Wars called Space Wars. He cast his brother Jonathan and built sets from "clay, flour, egg boxes and toilet rolls."[12] His uncle, who worked at NASA building guidance systems for the Apollo rockets, sent him some launch footage: "I re-filmed them off the screen and cut them in, thinking no-one would notice", Nolan later remarked.[5][16][17] From the age of eleven, he aspired to be a professional filmmaker.[11] Between 1981 and 1983, Nolan enrolled at Barrow Hills, a Catholic prep school in Weybridge, Surrey, run by Josephite priests.[18] In his teenage years, Nolan started making films with Adrien and Roko Belic. Nolan and Roko co–directed the surreal 8 mm Tarantella (1989), which was shown on Image Union, an independent film and video showcase on the Public Broadcasting Service.[note 1][22][23]

His family were Orthodox Jewish.[9][10] Spielberg's paternal grandparents were Jews from Ukraine,[11][12] who settled in Cincinnati in the 1900s; his grandmother was from Sudylkiv, and his grandfather was from Kamianets-Podilskyi.[13][14] Spielberg has three younger sisters: Anne, Sue, and Nancy.[15] In 1952, his family moved to Haddon Township, New Jersey after his father was hired by RCA.[16] Spielberg attended Hebrew school from 1953 to 1957, in classes taught by Rabbi Albert L. Lewis.[17]

In early 1957, the family moved to Phoenix, Arizona.[18][19] Spielberg had a bar mitzvah ceremony when he was thirteen.[20] His family was involved in the synagogue and had many Jewish friends.[21] Of the Holocaust, he said that his parents "talked about it all the time, and so it was always on my mind."[21] His father had lost between sixteen and twenty relatives in the Holocaust.[14] Spielberg found it difficult accepting his heritage; he said: "It isn't something I enjoy admitting [...] but when I was seven, eight, nine years old, God forgive me, I was embarrassed because we were Orthodox Jews. I was embarrassed by the outward perception of my parents' Jewish practices. I was never really ashamed to be Jewish, but I was uneasy at times."[22][23] Spielberg also suffered from anti-Semitism: "In high school, I got smacked and kicked around. Two bloody noses. It was horrible."[24][25][14] He grew away from Judaism during adolescence, after his family had moved to various neighborhoods and found themselves to be the only Jews.[26][27]

At age 12, he made his first home movie: a train wreck involving his toy Lionel trains.[28] In 1958, he became a Boy Scout and fulfilled a requirement for the photography merit badge by making a nine-minute, 8 mm film titled The Last Gunfight.[29][30] He eventually attained the rank of Eagle Scout.[31] Spielberg used his father's movie camera to make amateur features, and began taking the camera along on every Scout trip.[32] At age 13, Spielberg made a 40-minute war film, titled Escape to Nowhere, with a cast of school classmates. The film won first prize in a statewide competition.[33][34] Throughout his early teens, and after entering high school, Spielberg made about fifteen to twenty 8 mm "adventure" films.[35][36]</p>
